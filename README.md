## How to Use Proteus ISIS 7
     
Proteus ISIS 7 has a user-friendly interface that consists of several windows and toolbars. The main window is the schematic capture window, where you can draw your circuit using various components and wires. The components are organized in different categories, such as analog, digital, microcontrollers, power, etc. You can access them from the component mode toolbar or the component browser window.
     
To place a component on the schematic, you need to select it from the toolbar or the browser and click on the desired location on the sheet. You can also drag and drop components from the browser to the sheet. To connect components with wires, you need to select the wire mode from the toolbar and click on the pins of the components. You can also use buses and labels to simplify your wiring.
     
To edit a component's properties, such as its name, value or model, you need to double-click on it or right-click and choose Edit Properties. A dialog box will appear where you can change the parameters of the component. You can also use the property editor window to view and modify all the properties of your components.
     
To simulate your circuit, you need to select the simulation mode from the toolbar or press F8. A simulation toolbar will appear where you can control the simulation parameters, such as the run time, the step size and the stop condition. You can also use various instruments to measure and display your circuit's behavior, such as oscilloscopes, multimeters, logic analyzers, etc. You can access them from the instrument mode toolbar or the instrument browser window.
     
To debug your circuit, you need to select the debug mode from the toolbar or press F9. A debug toolbar will appear where you can set breakpoints, watch variables, step through your code and view registers and memory. You can also use various debugging tools to analyze and correct your circuit's errors, such as error markers, error list window, source code window, etc.
     
## Examples of Circuits Simulated with Proteus ISIS 7
     
Here are some examples of circuits that you can simulate and test with Proteus ISIS 7:
     
- A simple LED blinker using an Arduino Uno. You can program the Arduino using C code or graphical blocks in Flowcode. You can also view the Arduino's serial output in a virtual terminal.
